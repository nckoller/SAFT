# Project One
## Movie Hub

### Description
Welcome to Movie Hub! Where you can expand your movie horizons at the click of a button. We have a diverse selection of films you can search through by title, but if you want something more specific we provide that. Once you select a film you are able to also look for specific actors, directors and genres to influence what we recommend for you at the bottom of the page. We provide up to 3 suggestions based off what you are looking for, and from there you will be able to select the new film of your choice and fall down the rabbit hole of cinema. Who knows you may find something new that you've never heard of before.
